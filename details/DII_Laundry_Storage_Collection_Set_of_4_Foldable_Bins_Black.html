Also, in addition to being super lightweight, I’ve done some serious stuffing and squishing of blankets, towels etc., into this hamper so I didn’t have to make multiple trips up and down to apt laundry rooms.For people saying it’s small: it would probably be small for a family, maybe even for two people who put ALL their household laundry in here. I’m a single person and it works for me for about a week and a half to two weeks of mostly clothing, bath towels. The hamper can fit a queen size bed’s worth of bedding.",

We recently moved into a larger home. The home we had before was large enough for the six kids and my husband and I when we moved in, but then we started fostering two infants for a family member and it seems that is going to be longer-term than we had expected, plus we are watching another infant for another family member during the week, and we recently had another family member come and stay with us for an unknown period of time so it was time to upsize. However, the larger the house and the more people in it, the more organized everything has to be to keep it from becoming a total and utter mess. These fabric bins are perfect for keeping the walk-in closets and laundry room organized as well as the play room. Especially the play room. There are so many toys (tinker toys, Lincoln logs, Barbies, etc.) that should be kept together in sets and get lost if you just throw them in a toy box or one of those bigger plastic bins (which I don't like the look of). These bins hold the various sets/dolls easily and they look good from an organizational standpoint, which is important since the play room is off of one of the main living areas and there are French doors with glass windows that lead into the room. Definitely a great product if you want to organize and want organizational tools that look great and get the job done well.","purchase_model":"Size: Cube (4) Color: Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2017-08-21 17:47:13"},{"user":"Great Cook, Great Cook","content":"Update:.

The inside seems to be a stronger fabric.Its a big 30 inch tall laundry bag, with two large handles on both sides.Yes this does stand on its own once the clothes are in, it shapes to the hamper, although it can be knocked over.. Butfor me I put it inside my large laundry hamper in my closet I got at Target that is plastic,And deep, without a lid.This fits perfect and stands up , Its taller then my hamper, and is not falling over.Now, when this gets fill I just have to lift it out by the two handles, and carry it to my laundry room on the other side of my house.Before I was carry all our clothes, and dropping some on the way.I would also think this is good for the market, farmers market, put the kids puzzles inside, hang it on a door knob inThe closet for laundry ,guest bedroom hamper.etc..Looks like this is going to hold up well.5 stars.","purchase_model":"Size: Hamper/Bag Color: Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2017-08-26 17:47:13"},{"user":"Omar Siddique","content":"A usefully sized, sturdy set of 4 matching cubes.Short nylon handles on the sides make for easy pick-up. Removable bottom stiffeners allow10-15 pounds per cube. I didn't test any higher than 15 pounds-- I suspect I could go higher, but didn't want to stress the material unnecessarily. The dark marble color scheme fits in well with most decor and doesn't stand as out as much as their various other motifs (including the \"grey marble\" version of these cubes). That's a positive in my book, I want my utility storage to be discrete.Pictured: Organizing one gray tabby cat.As others have pointed out, \"laundry\" in the description does not mean the cubes are meant to hold actual laundry (unless it's toddler-sized clothes), but rather are targeted at organizing laundry areas. I used mine to organize under-sink cleaning supplies (fits easily in the kitchen cabinet), my less-used laundry supplies, and various/sundry items in the utility area. Besides looking far neater than a loose jumble of containers and bottles, the cubes make it easy to pick up / move things instead of grabbing one item at a time.Recommended.","purchase_model":"Size: Cube (4) Color: Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2017-09-06 17:47:13"},{"user":"Spencer in Seattle","content":"\r\nThe media could not be loaded.\r\n","purchase_model":"Size: Trapezoid Medium Color: Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2017-08-21 17:47:13"},{"user":"??

The fabric and looks nice enough to display (there is no need to hide these bins in a cupboard if you do not want to). However, they are small enough to fit easily under a kitchen or a bathroom sink, a closet, or any other common household storage area. Each bin is also lined with a black, fabric-like material. One thing to note: the description of the storage bins states that they are \"collapsible\". They are not. These storage bins have a permanent shape, and maintain that same shape (as pictured), whether you are using them or not.

The fabric feels like nylon -- very slippy and easy to wipe clean. The inner liner is more of a rough texture fabric that is a little more difficult to clean but, since it is black, it hides stains and smudges very well.The base is a cardboard insert that holds the sides open without any floppiness.
