A bag that's annoyingly hard to open, so you need to take extra care to avoid cutting the bag when releasing it from it's plastic prison. Once it's escaped the basket will be slightly wrinkly in places, but that's normal for vacuum sealed plastic bags, and the wrinkles quickly disappear once the basket is used.A basket that's well made from some form of plasticised fabric with a metal rim. With the fabric being nicely robust and durable, something that's also waterproof. Plus, after you've filled it with smelly socks, it's also really easy to clean.The metal ring is good at helping the basket maintaining its shape while remaining sturdy and useable.Yet it's also collapsible for easy storage if that rare event occurs. I say rare because from the moment it arrived it was instantly pressed into service.Something that's nicely spacious and capable for storing loads of stuff, especially dirty laundry.Something that it does without sagging too much.Plus, even though it's nicely lightweight, it has handles as well, so there's no excuse when the kids say they can't lift it.Though best of all is the happy fun design, something that's well printed with nice bright colours.A design that would work on the beach as well as in a bathroom or bedroom. Features that make it well worth the asking price.",

	var commentsList = [{"user":"Marie B","content":"I found and ordered my first of these collapsible bins by Clastyle about 1-1/2 years ago.Since then, I have purchased many other of their designs for either my own use or to give as gifts.With each of their designs, I think they look cute on the product page - but they look even better in person.This is my first summer-time design - most of the others I have in the house are either fall or winter related. The design on each side is different, which allows you to choose which one you want to display. When it gets warm out and I start using this one regularly, I might have to switch between the two designs because I like them both. But if pressed, I might admit that the parrot riding a board edges out the crab design. LolThe inside of these bins is plastic.Wet items (like wash cloths or towels) will not seep outside of the bin.Same for if the bin is placed on top of a wet area, the water will not seep into it.I have used these bins in so many ways over the last year and a half:Laundry - holding dirty items waiting for wash, holding clean items from the dryer, and holding folded laundry that just didn't have another home at the timeStorage - holding extra throw pillows, holding toys for the grands, holding stuffed animals, holding books (temporarily - not something I would suggest for long-term), holding extra blankets, holding boxes of puzzles that didn't have another home at the time, holding magazines and puzzle booksTransport - moving items from one room in the house to another, moving items out to the car and on to their ultimate location, moving items in from the carDecoration - this brand has year-round designs, so matter what is in them (if anything), they provide instant seasonal decorationGift Basket/Item - I purchased and gave several designs as gifts around the holidays both of the last couple years; a few I even used as gift baskets to hold the other gift items for that person or additional family itemsThese collapsible bins absolutely get a work out around my place, and they have not disappointed yet.While I recommend not trying to move them with extremely heavy objects in them, they will hold about anything you can think to place in them.","purchase_model":"Size: 40*30*30 cm Color: Crab  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-31 17:47:12"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"This is a decent sized storage basket that I got to test out in the back of our SUV to hold detritus that collects back there: grocery bags, water bottles, snacks, random socks and flip flops, wet wipes, etc...Pros:Generously sized and will fit all the bags and other items you need to organize.Water resistant fabric would make this good to put things in that might leak like water bottles or wet towels.Can easily be wiped clean.Has handles to assist in carrying.Folds flat when not in use.Cons:Design isn't the most understated look.Basket only has a frame at the top, so it will collapse on itself if it isn't filled to the topLack of internal support forces the material to hold the weight of the contents, so it isn't designed to carry anything with heft to it.","purchase_model":"Size: 40*30*30 cm Color: Crab  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-26 17:47:12"},{"user":"songslady","content":"....of which I have quite a few since I live near the Gulf of Mexico.I like the colorful print on this cute storage basket, as well as the fact that it's waterproof.It's very light and can collapse when not in use.Of course collapsing it will probably never happen as it's very handy for holding or storing just about anything.When grandkids come over and we go to the beach I can remove the towels and put in the beach toys.I would definitely buy more if the price was a little bit lower, as this is a very handy, well made and versatile storage basket.","purchase_model":"Size: 40*30*30 cm Color: Crab  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-20 17:47:12"},{"user":"Here for the Objective Facts/Subjective Opinions","content":"This is a large fabric basket that is ideal for your home to keep your living areas nicely organized.

He has a ton of toys and I'm always stumbling over them, just like kid's toys. When I saw this cute bin I thought, \"toy bin for the dog!\"He doesn't clean up his toys like a kid; I do that. And he will go to the bin to pick it the toy he wants to play with. He's so funny, digging around in the bin, all excited to find the one he wants. This bin is cute as can be. It's well made and sturdy, and affordable.","purchase_model":"Size: 40*30*30 cm Color: Crab  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-17 17:47:12"},{"user":"Georgie","content":"Nice bright and cheerful tropical-island design on this pop-up storage basket, with a smiling crab on one side and a sunglasses-wearing parrot on the other (see photo).It comes folded flat-very compact-and then it's just a case of holding the handles and pushing down the base to get it to shape.Nothing to hold it there, or to fasten, clip, or adjust, it is self-supporting.Handles are straps fixed to the top of both ends and the perfect size for lifting-big enough to get hands in, yet no so big that they get in the way.The \"fabric\" seems to be plastic (listing says polyester, and I'm not disputing that) which is waterproof and non-breathable as far as I can tell.I do wonder about how easy it would puncture, rip, or tear if it suffered damage, but have no intention of deliberately finding out!For me, it will have multiple uses, but initially it is, indeed, for laundry.Very pleased with it and it gets full marks from me.","purchase_model":"Size: 40*30*30 cm Color: Crab  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-27 17:47:12"},{"user":"MrSparky","content":"This lovely laundry basket arrives tightly packed in a easy to recycle vacuum sealed plastic bag. A bag that's annoyingly hard to open, so you need to take extra care to avoid cutting the bag when releasing it from it's plastic prison. Once it's escaped the basket will be slightly wrinkly in places, but that's normal for vacuum sealed plastic bags, and the wrinkles quickly disappear once the basket is used.A basket that's well made from some form of plasticised fabric with a metal rim. With the fabric being nicely robust and durable, something that's also waterproof. Plus, after you've filled it with smelly socks, it's also really easy to clean.The metal ring is good at helping the basket maintaining its shape while remaining sturdy and useable.Yet it's also collapsible for easy storage if that rare event occurs. I say rare because from the moment it arrived it was instantly pressed into service.Something that's nicely spacious and capable for storing loads of stuff, especially dirty laundry.Something that it does without sagging too much.Plus, even though it's nicely lightweight, it has handles as well, so there's no excuse when the kids say they can't lift it.Though best of all is the happy fun design, something that's well printed with nice bright colours.A design that would work on the beach as well as in a bathroom or bedroom. Features that make it well worth the asking price.","purchase_model":"Size: 40*30*30 cm Color: Crab  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-27 17:47:12"}];
